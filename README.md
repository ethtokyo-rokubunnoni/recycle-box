# Recycle Contract DApp

The Recycle Contract DApp aims to help users clean their wallets, save on gas fees and time, and provide a convenient way to convert small balances and unwanted tokens into a useful NFT with future utility. The DApp will run on the Polygon network and provide an accessible and user-friendly interface for managing and recycling tokens.

## Introduction

The Recycle Contract DApp is a decentralized application designed to help users manage their tokens in their wallets by recycling small balances and unwanted tokens. By using the DApp, users can convert these tokens into a valuable NFT with future utility. The DApp will be deployed on the Polygon network and provide a user-friendly interface for managing and recycling tokens.

## Purpose

This README serves as a guide for the development team and ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project scope and objectives. It defines the requirements for the Recycle Contract DApp, including functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, user roles, and acceptance criteria.

## Scope

The scope of the Recycle Contract DApp includes:

- Providing users with an interface to view and manage their wallet balances
- Allowing users to select and recycle tokens in their wallets
- Categorizing tokens and handling them accordingly
- Converting recycled tokens into an NFT for the user

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication

- Users can connect their wallet to the DApp
- Users can sign and verify their wallet to prove ownership

### Token Management

- Users can view the tokens in their wallet
- Users can select the tokens they want to recycle
- Users can initiate the recycling process by clicking the recycle button

### Token Categorization

- The system automatically categorizes tokens into four types: Main tokens, Stablecoins, Altcoins, and Scam tokens
- Main tokens and stablecoins are deposited into a yield-generating platform
- Altcoins are pooled until the total value of each type of altcoin reaches $10 or more, and then they are sold on 1inch DEX in exchange for ETH
- Scam tokens trigger a warning to the user, and the system considers automatically sending them to a burning wallet to permanently remove them from circulation

### NFT Issuance

- Upon completion of the token recycling process, users will receive a randomly generated NFT as a reward
- The number of NFTs received per transaction is fixed at one, regardless of the amount of tokens recycled
- Each NFT features a random picture, which is distributed randomly among users. It is possible for users to receive the same picture more than once
- Users have the option to sell or trade their NFTs on secondary markets, providing additional utility and potential value for the NFTs
- The NFTs issued have future utility, which may include access to exclusive content, discounts, or other benefits within the ecosystem

### User Refunds and Claims

- A portion of the ETH generated from the sale of Altcoins will be refunded to the user
- Refunded ETH will accumulate in the user's account, and users can claim their refunds at any time

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- The DApp should respond quickly to user actions and provide real-time feedback
- The system should efficiently handle recycling transactions to minimize gas fees

### Security

- The DApp should follow best practices for smart contract development and user data protection
- The system should be resistant to common security vulnerabilities and attacks

### Usability

- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use for both experienced and inexperienced users
- The DApp should provide clear instructions and guidance for users throughout the recycling process

## System Architecture

The Recycle Contract DApp will consist of:

- A smart contract deployed on the Polygon network to handle token recycling and NFT issuance
- A web-based frontend for users to interact with the DApp and manage their tokens
- Integration with external services such as wallet providers, 1 inch DEX, and yield-generating platforms

## User Roles

### End-User

- Connect and verify their wallet
- View and manage wallet tokens
- Initiate the recycling process and receive an NFT

## Acceptance Criteria

The Recycle Contract DApp will be considered complete and ready for deployment when it meets the following criteria:

- The smart contract has been thoroughly tested and audited for security vulnerabilities and potential risks
- The DApp successfully allows users to connect their wallets and verify ownership
- The DApp accurately displays the user's token balances and allows them to select tokens for recycling
- The system can correctly categorize tokens into Main tokens, Stablecoins, Altcoins, and Scam tokens
- The DApp can process the recycling transaction according to the predefined rules for each token category
- Users receive an NFT upon completing the recycling process
- The user interface is easy to use and provides clear guidance throughout the recycling process

## Project Timeline

This section outlines the estimated timeline for the development, testing, and deployment of the Recycle Contract DApp:

- Planning and Requirements Gathering: 2 days
- Smart Contract Development: 2 days
- Frontend Development: 3 days

## Glossary

- DApp: Decentralized Application, a software application that runs on a distributed computing system such as a blockchain
- Polygon: A scalable, Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform for building and deploying decentralized applications
- NFT: Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset representing ownership of a specific item or piece of content on a blockchain
- MATIC: The native cryptocurrency of the Polygon network, used for transaction fees and other network operations
- 1 inch DEX: A decentralized exchange aggregator that allows users to trade tokens across multiple platforms for the best available price

## Future Expansions and Integrations

The Recycle Contract DApp is designed with scalability and adaptability in mind, allowing for potential future expansions and integrations with various platforms and networks. Some possibilities include:

- Integration with additional decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap, to offer users more trading options and better rates when recycling tokens
- Integration with DeBank, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, to provide users with more yield-generating opportunities for their recycled tokens
- Adding support for additional blockchains, such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, to extend the reach of the DApp and accommodate a broader range of users and
